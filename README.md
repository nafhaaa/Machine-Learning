# Machine-Learning using Python
I created a comprehensive report and developed ten machine learning models using three distinct datasets, addressing tasks in unsupervised learning, regression, and classification. The process involved thorough data cleaning, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer specific research questions, which were then compared with existing literature. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted, and the K-Means algorithm was applied to identify homogeneous groups of consumers for a wholesaler.Four distinct classification models were developed to categorize diabetic patients, and the most effective model was identified. Four different regression models were modelled to predict the medical cost insurance and the best model was found.
